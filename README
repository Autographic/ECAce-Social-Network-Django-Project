This is the ECAce academic social network project.

We are developing this as a resource for ENCS (Engineering and Compter Science) 
students at Concordia University in Montreal, Quebec. We have chosen open source 
development, as our developer team is 100% volunteer and because we're using 
an open source framework (Django) to create the project.

It consists of several main applications:
base - the most generic sections; login/logout, extensin of sites.site, etc.
concordia - models specifically based on Concordia's needs and academic structure.
humanity - an application for dealing with people in, well, a human fashion.
magazine - an engine for publishing pretty content, with help from Photologue for images.
society - an engine for managing engineering society websites and internal documentation.
competition - an engine for intercollegiate competitions.
